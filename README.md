## OVERVIEW

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront app which takes in orders from the customer and depletes stock from the store's inventory. If the current stock is too low to fulfill the purchase request they will recieve a notification. MySQL and Inquirer are used for data input and storage.

## INSTRUCTIONS

   * Navigate to the bamazonCustomer.js file and type `node bamazonCustomer` in terminal or GitBash to start the app and display items in stock. 
   * Type the item id number of the product you would like to purchase.
   * Type in how many of this item you would like to purchase.
   * If there are enough in stock, the total price is calculated and displayed.
